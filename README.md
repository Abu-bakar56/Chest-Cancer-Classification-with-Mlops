# 🩺 Chest Cancer Classification with MLOps on AWS 🌐  

A **state-of-the-art machine learning project** for classifying chest cancer types, integrating **MLOps practices** for streamlined development and deployment, and hosted on **AWS Cloud Services**. The model distinguishes between:  
- **Adenocarcinoma**  
- **Large Cell Carcinoma**  
- **Normal**  
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**  

---

## 🚀 Features:
- **Accurate Classification**: Detects and classifies different chest cancer types with high precision.  
- **MLOps Pipeline**: Implements a full **CI/CD pipeline** with automated training, testing, and deployment.  
- **AWS Deployment**: Hosted on AWS for high availability and scalability.  
- **Interactive API**: Provides endpoints for real-time predictions and insights.  
- **Visualization Tools**: Generates heatmaps and visual explanations using Grad-CAM.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies:
- **Backend**: Flask, FastAPI, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow.  
- **MLOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS S3, Lambda, EC2, and SageMaker.  
- **Frontend**: React.js for a responsive dashboard.  
- **Machine Learning**: CNN-based deep learning models for feature extraction and classification.  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Grad-CAM for model interpretability.

## 🔧 Installation:
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chest-cancer-classifier.git
   cd chest-cancer-classifier
   ```  
2. Build and run the Docker container:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```  
3. Access the app locally:  
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.  

---

## 🌟 How It Works:
1. Upload a chest X-ray image for analysis.  
2. The model processes the image and predicts the cancer type.  
3. View classification results and Grad-CAM heatmaps for insights.  

---

## 📈 MLOps Workflow:
- **Data Pipeline**: Automates data collection, cleaning, and storage on AWS S3.  
- **Model Training**: Uses SageMaker for training and versioning.  
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions for automated testing.  
- **Continuous Deployment**: Deploys models to AWS Lambda for real-time predictions.
